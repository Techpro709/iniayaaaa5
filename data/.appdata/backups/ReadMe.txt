Normal functionalities of the Archive don't rely on contents in this folder. No bad things will happen if you delete this folder.

Archive.html works completely offline, and these .js files contain the record of what you have downloaded. When you launch the downloader on a new day, a backup of these .js files will be created.

By using these backups to replace these files back into .appdata, you can travel back in time. In theory, this can be useful if the developer releases a new patch with a bug that breaks your Archive. In reality, however, this has never happened.

Note:
1. Backup happens no more than once a day.
2. Only the recent 10 backups are kept, older ones are deleted.
3. If you need to travel back in time for some reason, make sure you understand the mechanism, manually backup your current files before overwriting them, and restore them before you run the downloader again (so that you don't re-download videos that you've already downloaded).
4. â˜… If mp4 files were deleted, they cannot come back.
